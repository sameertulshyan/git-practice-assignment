# Implementing Agile at the leadership level

I recently came across [this fascinating article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/duenablomstrom1/2019/02/11/agile-starts-at-the-top/#185e12aa4421). The Agile methodology has seen widespread adoption across the realm of software engineering in recent years. Receiving widespread acclaim for addressing many of the traditional pitfalls of software engineering (**cone of uncertainty, anyone?**), many have sought to translate these positive effects to other areas of companies, such as operations and marketing.

But what does Agile look like **_at the leadership level?_** What is an Agile leader? In the author's estimation, it is not possible to be an Agile organization if the approach is not extended to leadership. In a practical sense, this often involves tacking a step back from *traditional* hierarchical ways of leadership, and embracing flexibility and responsiveness to change.

Awesome Article! I was really curious about if Agile could exists for a Company
Structure apart from software development and this article seems to not only yes,
but that it's critical to scaling company Success. If Amazon has to show **anything**
for the success of continually reimagining their vision and implementation, starting
as an online book retailer, moving to an online superstore and now crowding out
the Web Service industry, then it says that Agile Methodologies can give you an
edge up on you competitors at an industry level.
